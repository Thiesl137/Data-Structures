````
var a = 'lorem';
console.log(a);
````

* To test your functions, open index.html in your browser
** NOTE: While completing the challenges, if all tests that previously passed ALL suddenly fail, there is most likely a syntax error in your code. Open Chrome Dev Tool's to locate the cause of the error.
